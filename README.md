## About

I am an engineering manager with a diverse background and strong technical expertise. I have experience launching MVPs to market and organizing large-scale refactoring projects in corporations. I help businesses grow faster by bridging gaps with my all-around skills, systematic approach, and passion for transparent processes.

I value people’s drive for growth and strive to help those around me grow quickly and comfortably. For me, mentorship isn’t just about teaching someone new skills; it’s about creating a solid foundation and comprehensive support for individuals who want to self-educate and make a difference.

## Experience

### [Pontem Nerwork](https://pontem.network/), Lisbon, 2023-2024
> As the __Head of Pontem Wallet__, I led few teams and helped scale our product. I hired and built a strong team department, managed partnerships, and streamlined our development process. I worked closely with the CTO and CEO to ensure our goals aligned with the company vision. My efforts in restructuring the architecture made it easy to add new blockchains quickly, boosting our product's capabilities and reach new audience.

I used my personal twitter and attract to my DM over 100 people (from 50k views), conducted around 40 interviews, and hired 6 key team members including a head of QA, two team leaders, and senior full-stack developers. The hiring process was collaborative and well documented. I also mentored new leads, gradually handing over responsibilities and supporting them as they grew into their roles.

I was actively involved in development, initially handling refactoring and creating the whole app architecture. Created parts of the interface to serve as organizational examples for other developers. And setting up an independent core with a isolated communication layer. Using my past experience, I picked out all the common things from different blockchains, and started development by creating a guide to how to add a new chain. Already on top of the guide I am build APIs with a key focus on DX.

### [Roketo](https://roke.to/), Lisbon, 2022-2023
> As the __Chief Technology Officer__ of Roketo, I used my network to find and hire talented individuals and build dev team from scratch, focusing on autonomous, high-qualified candidates. Managed a team of up to 20 developers. I also engaged in devrel and helping with marketing strategy. Despite crisis market challenges, I took on multiple roles to keep the company moving forward.

With hand-zone at the beginning i was concentrated on developing core components and SDKs to bootstrap various prototypes, facilitating options for pivoting. I handled code reviews for Rust smart contracts, wrote parts of them, and implemented auto-generation CI/CD for the TS SDK from rust sources. These efforts ensured a solid foundation for rapid development and prototyping. 

I engaged with the developer community by writing and proofreading articles, speaking at AMAs and conferences, and organizing an online hackathon to increase SDK users. I also judged at the Nearcon hackathon for recognizability and helped create a marketing and content strategy for social networks. These activities were crucial in building a strong developer community and promoting our product effectively.

### [Sbermarket](https://app.sbermarket.ru/), Saint Petersburg, 2021-2022
> I was hired as __Head of Frontend Platform__ at Sbermarket to grow the department from 5 people to 40 employees in order to achieve company objectives. I facilitated architecture documentation processes, led the process of separating the frontend from the rails monolith, implemented OKRs and PDPs. I was responsible for incident management, set up performance metrics and reported KPIs.

I, as well as my subordinates, ran coaching calls for product frontenders. We were responsible for the performance of a total of 200 frontenders and worked on refactoring projects with our own hands - mostly moving frontend components from old rails monolyth to micro-frontend architecture. We collected feedback and incrementally improved DX, and I built performance metrics, evaluating how our suggestions would impact development process.

The most important work turned out to be the formalization and tuning of the hiring and onboarding pipeline. The initially unpredictable process was formalized in confluence documentation in the format of simple guidelines: from the form of note-taking during the hiring process, with examples of questions and challenges, to welcome tasks from the backlog and a clear checklist of what a newcomer needs to do. That actions made onboarding process timeline from a few months to a very comfortable two weeks for a new frontend developer.

Documenting of the frontend architecture and enforcing technical agreements, on top of the basic daily work, was a big challenge that paid off. I created a collaborative environment where developers can propose their ideas and discuss them according to my defined process for changing the agreements through PR. As a result, the overall number of conflicts decreased and the code-review process took less than a day on average, when in the past some requests used to hang around for weeks.

### [Fintuity](https://fintuity.com/), London (*remotely*), 2021 (*a half year*)
> I was hired as __Head of Frontend__ at Fintuity to make the frontend delivery process predictable, before me releases were not transparent and happened through a lot of pain and fixes every half a year at best. I achieved a predictable release through refactoring fragile parts with my own hands, partially automating testing, hiring multiple employees and dividing the areas of responsibility between them.

Carried out a complete transformation of the workflow. Started with setting up a process of task decomposition, providing developers with atomic and described tickets of several days' volume. Implemented: a planning ritual, code review of frontend code, manual testing before meging PRs on demostands. Documented the state of the code and rewrote the most fragile parts with my own hands, covering them with autotests.

### [Yandex.Classifieds](https://auto.ru), Saint Petersburg, 2019 - 2021
> My goal as __Team Lead__ at Yandex.Classefields (auto.ru and realty.ya.ru) was to build a team to develop administrative services for moderators, support and sales from scratch. I was an active individual contributor as well as gathering requirements from stakeholders, structuring them into a product description, recruiting team members and implementing several closely related tools.

Keeping developers out of the production database and out of dealing with issues of users and internal customers wants. It was necessary to create a lot of small utilities, with a single system of permissions that would be maintained by the security department. At the same time, fencing off access rights would have stopped work due to customer complaints. My work started in gathering requirements between 10 different stakeholder groups, finding a compromise and creating a backlog and a common prioritization system for all, as well as estimating the required capacity in order to hire developers. I structured the development process from 0 and formed two independent teams of 8 people.

### [Yandex.Market](https://market.yandex.ru/), Saint Petersburg, 2018 - 2019

> As a __Frontend Architect__ at Yandex.Market, I was a stakeholder for several internal components, including the development of an internal React-based framework. I was part of the on-call team and handled incidents. I worked towards achieving key company infrastructure OKRs related to TTI/TTFB and participated in a major refactoring project, coordinating work and resource allocation among dozens of developers.

Responded to SDK developers' issues: collected feedback, fixed bugs and improved DX. Continuously developed documentation and collected FAQs for frequent questions from developers.

Responsible as project manager for a large project transitioning from old infrastructure to new one. Led organizational calls, documented the architectural design, and assisted with resolving issues that occurred. Overall coordinated the process for specific parts of the application.

Set up experiments using binary formats for client-server communication and proposed implementation solution roadmap. Implemented mechanism for bulk progressive initialization to significantly save resources during server-side rendering (SSR). Done experiments with HTTP/2 to reduce the number of backend connections.

### [Ridgebox](https://ridgebox.com/), New York (*remotely*), 2017 - 2018
> As the __Team Lead__ of the MVP cross functional dev team in Ridgebox and as a top frontend developer in the company, I reinforced the frontend competencies in the company. Thanks to me a lot of frontenders were hired and a hiring and onboarding pipeline was built. Have done 75+ interviews. I designed all key frontend components and mentored developers.

Joined the brandbot.com project when deadlines were tight and provided an early start to the project. It was planned to be about 6 months of work, but I was able to cut it down to 3 months. All due to the fact that I threw all my individual resources on the most complex component and work with Web 3d graphics via Three.js myself.

Coordinated team building for the prototyping of peregrine.io. Hired 7 people including an AI specialist and launched the MVP to first 1000 users in a short time (about 4 months). Helped the company deal with issues that came up during the launch. Enforced everything with metrics, on-call, and made sure delivery to production was on schedule.

### [LPTracker](http://lptracker.ru/), Saint Petersburg, 2016 - 2017
> I was invited to join an experimental team to develop an AI-based website builder prototype as a __Team Lead__ to LPTracker. My role involved hiring a team of developers, setting up processes, and working closely with the product manager to bring the vision to life.

Analyzed competitors, designed the UX, developed core components using and brought the MVP to its first 100 users in just 2 months. Incrementally developing the product, relying on metrics and ensuring its stability, prepared everything for possible pivots.

Techstack was **Nodejs**, **React** and **Python**.

### [Convermax](https://convermax.com/), Rostov-on-Don, 2016 (*a half year*)
> I joined the development team as __Frontend Developer__ to work on Onewindowapp.com portal, contributing to the development as individual contributor and participating in technical leadership. **Typescript** and **Angular 3**.

Delivered a real-time chat and a own wysiwyg editor (medium-editor alike). Acquired experience on working in a big team with polished business-processes.

### [RNDSoft](https://rnds.pro/), Rostov-on-Don, 2014-2016
> Participated in a variety of internal projects (b2c, b2b, b2g) as a __Frontend Developer__. Starting with simple landing pages all the way up to SPA applications built on **angular JS** with backend on **Ruby on Rails**.

- Opensea.pro: SPA portal. Done layouts and interactive elements development along with fillable forms and analytics. 
- don24.ru molotro.ru – both portals are designed as a singular service including a public comment section, news feed and an administration interface for publication pipeline.
- Esia.pro – a landing page and an authorization module using Bitrix ESIA
- priem.donland.ru – an interactive governor office with a video chat based on webtrc. Including an interface and pipeline for problem solving: real people applying to solve their issues and completing paperwork along with government employees. 

Started out as a developer, but as my experience grew I took up more and more responsibilities in a team with good business processes. Took part in onboarding new coworkers and brought additional value to the projects. Worked on a variety of projects full-circle, including negotiations.
